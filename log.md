# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: October 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Reading the docs!

**Thoughts:** No real coding done today, just a lot of reading docs and figuring out the basics of React again. I liked the structure of the React docs as well--it gave me some ideas about how to structure my own documentation/tutorials in the future.

### Day 2: October 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working through React exercises on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Some parts made more sense today, some parts didn't. Tomorrow I'm going to read the React docs and go from there.

### Day 1: October 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working through React exercises on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I should have started over from the beginning since it had been at least a month since I last looked at React. I didn't understand much of what I was doing, but I have a better vision of where to go now.

### Pre-Challenge: October 21, 2019

**Thoughts:** I want to do this to create a commitment to coding, to finally work on some projects that have been brewing in my head for a while, and to improve my coding ability. I plan to work with the freeCodeCamp curriculum, specifically the Front End Libraries and Data Visiualization portion. Plus, everyone's always doing Summer of Code, and I think Winter of Code deserves more love.
