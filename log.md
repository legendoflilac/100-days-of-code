# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: October 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Tackled fCC's React challenges again, this time with much greater understanding. Tomorrow I will start with the challenge [Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdatePassed](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react/optimize-re-renders-with-shouldcomponentupdate). 

**Thoughts:** I felt more confident doing these challenges a second time. This helped cement more of the fundamentals and helped me understand why I'm writing the code, rather than just blindly following the prompts.

### Day 5: October 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** React Docs and the React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial.

**Thoughts:** React is starting to feel a little more familiar, but creating components, knowing the flow of information from one component to another, and doing anything outside of the examples still feels like a stretch. I feel a lot like I did when I was doing the algorithm challenges back when I was just learning JavaScript--like I wasn't given the tools to solve the problems and yet am still somehow expected to come up with an elegant answer. There's got to be a balance between hand-holding and throwing the baby into the ocean, but I haven't found it yet.

### Day 4: October 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More docs!

**Thoughts:** I gleaned more information about React and forked the Tic Tac Toe pen on CodePen so I can follow along with the tutorial tomorrow.

5. [React Docs -- Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

### Day 3: October 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Reading the docs!

**Thoughts:** No real coding done today, just a lot of reading docs and figuring out the basics of React again. I liked the structure of the React docs as well--it gave me some ideas about how to structure my own documentation/tutorials in the future.

### Day 2: October 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working through React exercises on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Some parts made more sense today, some parts didn't. Tomorrow I'm going to read the React docs and go from there.

### Day 1: October 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working through React exercises on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I should have started over from the beginning since it had been at least a month since I last looked at React. I didn't understand much of what I was doing, but I have a better vision of where to go now.

### Pre-Challenge: October 21, 2019

**Thoughts:** I want to do this to create a commitment to coding, to finally work on some projects that have been brewing in my head for a while, and to improve my coding ability. I plan to work with the freeCodeCamp curriculum, specifically the Front End Libraries and Data Visiualization portion. Plus, everyone's always doing Summer of Code, and I think Winter of Code deserves more love.
