# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: November 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Drum Machine project.

**Thoughts:** I got all the buttons to at least appear thanks to `.map`. I developed the event handler some, but audio is still not working yet. I also have the display area to finish up. This is taking longer than expected, but I also haven't had as many long blocks of time to dedicate to this.

### Day 17: November 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Drum Machine project.

**Thoughts:** I was really optimistic that I would understand this better today, but I'm pretty sure I confused myself even more. Still haven't gotten even one button to work yet.

### Day 16: November 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Drum Machine project.

**Thoughts:** It's one of those days where I don't know what I'm doing. I don't even know where to start for handling the key presses and playing the audio. I've been looking at how other people completed the project for reference, but I don't want to use ideas that work but are incomprehensible to me. I need to be able to understand what's going on in the project. I started to work on just getting one button to work, so we'll see if I can complete that during tomorrow's coding time.

### Day 15: November 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started drum machine project.

**Thoughts:** I have the larger idea of the app written in React, but due to some of the tests I need to pass this time I may have to break apart the code into smaller components. Additionally, I'm not super sure what to use for audio. I'm torn between using the same audio files as in the sample project and finding some other audio to use to make it more fun. I'm also not sure how to handle keydown events in React, so that's something I need to learn and implement.

### Day 14: November 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished (?) markdown previewer project.

**Thoughts:** I started to not be looking forward to this project because I was struggling so much getting the design to look how I envisioned it. I had to have a moment today where I just accepted it where it was, ran the tests on it, saw that they passed, and was just happy I did that much. There may come a period of time when I want to revise, but for right now, it's just going to look like this.

### Day 13: November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued markdown previewer project, with a focus on CSS.

**Thoughts:** CSS seems completely foreign to me sometimes. What I intend and what happens on screen are very different things sometimes. I still have to look into breaking the app into components for practice, but I'm so focused on the design aspect that the React stuff is gone by the wayside in my mind.

### Day 12: November 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued markdown previewer project.

**Thoughts:** I focused less on breaking up the app into different components and instead researched how to get marked.js to work in the intended manner. I learned that passing `{marked(this.state.input)}` displays the return value f
